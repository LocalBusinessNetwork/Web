				    <ol class="secondary-items">
				      <li>
				        <h4>Law and Forum for Legal Disputes</h4>
				        <p> This Agreement or any claim, cause of action or dispute ("claim") arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California regardless of your country of origin or where you access ReferralWire, and notwithstanding of any conflicts of law principles and the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods.  You and ReferralWire agree that all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below.  You and ReferralWire agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Contra Costa County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims.

				        <h4>Arbitration Option.</h4>
				        <p> For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration.  In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties.  The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p>

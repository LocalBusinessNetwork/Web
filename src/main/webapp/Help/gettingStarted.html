	<h2>Setting up your user account</h2>

	<div class="helpSection">
		<div id="contactInfo" class="contentSection">
			<h3>Contact information</h3>
			<div class="tier2">
				<img src="screenshots/myContactInfo.png" style="float:right;padding-left:30px">
				This is your digital business card. It includes all the address-book fields that your partners will use to contact you, such as your phone numbers, email address and the physical location of your business.
				<p>It also includes a place to add a thumbnail-sized photograph of yourself. Photos enable partners who may have only met you once or twice to "put a face to the name."  For best results, the photograph should be the same height and width.  It should also be less than an inch tall.</p> 
				<p><b>Getting There</b> To set up your contact information click on: <b><i>Menu > My Account > Contact Info</i></b></p>
				<p><b>Search Tags</b> By default ReferralWire enables your partners to find you by typing any of the following into a list filter: 
					<ul>
						<li>Your first name</li>
						<li>You last name, or</li>
						<li>You company name</li>
					</ul>
					You can also add custom search tags that enable partners to find you with other key words. For example, an accountant might add search tags such as "CPA," "Accountant," "Book Keeping," "Taxes," and "IRS" to his or her profile.  The accountant's name will subsequently appear when any of these terms are typed into the Partner List filter. </p>
					<p>To use this feature, simply type a list of terms into the Search Tags field separated by spaces.  The Search Tags field will accept a maximum of 50 characters.

			<h3>Qualifications</h3>
			<div class="tier2">
				<img src="screenshots/myQualifications.png" style="float:right;padding-left:30px;padding-bottom:30px">
				The qualifications page is a place to summarize your background, services and certifications.  Your partners can refer to this information and show it to prospective customers.  Before adding content to your qualifications page, you'll see placeholder images and sample text that indicate where content will appear.  These will be replaced after you supply your own details.  To add content, click the Edit button on the page header and the Qualifications Wizard will appear.   
				<p>The qualifications view includes a place to add to a larger picture of yourself and an image of your company's logo. For best results, your picture should be approximately 1 inch wide and 1.5 inches tall.  Your company's logo should be square and no more than 1 inch tall and wide.
				<p><b>Power Partners</b> The qualifications page provides a place for you to declare up to three different "Power Partner" categories.  These represent other types of businesses that provide complementary services to your clientele. 
				<p><b>Getting There</b> To set up your contact information click on: <b><i>Menu > My Account > Qualifications</i></b></p>
				<p><b>Printing your Qualifications</b> To print your profile, click on the print icon <img style="height:20px" src="../images/icons/printerIconHelp.png">.  Your browser must accept pop up windows from ReferralWire for you to see the print-optimized window containing your profile.  <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-size:.9em">Note: At this time, the print feature is only supported on Chrome and Safari.</span></p>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Quote Title</b> This is a short excerpt from the quote that summarizes the key take-away.  It will appear as a headline above the actual quote.  Examples might include "Julie transformed our outdoor space..." or "Our revenues went up by 15%" or "Michael's input was invaluable" A good title is three to five words long. </li>
					<li><b>Quote Text</b> This is the actual verbatim quote from which the headline was extracted. A good quote is one to two sentences long.</li>
					<li><b>Quote Source</b> This names the source of the quote.  At a minimum, the source should include the full name of the individual who volunteered the quote.  It may also include the person's title or a description of the role he or she played when working with you -- e.g., "VP of Sales, Chevron Corporation" or "Father of the Bride" or "Seller - 312 Elm Street."</li>

				<div class="tier2">
				<img src="screenshots/ReferralTypes.png" style="width:400px; float:right;padding-left:30px;padding-bottom:30px">
				ReferralWire enables users to make two different types of referrals:
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Prospect Referrals</b></i> provide the partner with the prospective customer's contact information and a brief explanation of why the prospect is in the market for the partner's services.  The partner who receives the referral can then contact the prospect. </li>
						<li><b><i>Power Partner Referrals</b></i> introduce two businesses to each other under the assumption that the two parties would offer some mutual benefit to one another.  Both parties are notified of the referral - and if they both accept, they will become connected as partners on ReferralWire. </li>
					</ul>
				Users can also make a <b><i>Direct Invitation</i></b> to an existing ReferralWire member or a contact.  Invitations sent to contacts will generate an email with a link that allows the contact to register as a ReferralWire member.  	
				</div>

			<div id="OutOfNetworkReferrals" class="contentSection">
				<h3>Do the partners who receive the referral have to be ReferralWire members?</h3>

					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Partner</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;can be a ReferralWire member with whom you're connected, or one of your contacts with a valid email.</li>
						<li><b><i>Prospective Customer</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;can be either one of your contacts (no email required) - or one of your partners - because partners can be customers too! </li>

				Referrals can made directly from the home page by clicking on the button labeled <b><i>Make a referral !</i></b>  Referrals can also be initiated by selecting a contact or partner record and clicking the <i><b>Refer</i></b> button in the upper right corner.  Each of these gestures opens the Referral Wizard.  The Referral Wizard will guide you through selecting the parties whom you wish to connect - and providing them with the the reason for the referral.
				<p></p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Step 1: Referral Type</b>
							<ol type="a">
								<li><i>"What kind of referral is this?"</i>  Select the radio option: <i>"I want to introduce a partner to a prospective customer."</i></li>

							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><b>Step 2: Who</b>
							<ol type="a">
								<li><i>"Who's the customer (potential buyer)?"</i>  Select one of your contacts or one of your ReferralWire partners.   This person's email and phone number will be shared with the partner.</li>
								<li><i>"Who's the partner (potential seller)?"</i>   Select one of your existing ReferralWire partners -- or one of your contacts (with a valid email address).</li>
								<li><i>"What's the partner's profession?"</i>  If you choose an existing ReferralWire partner - his or her professional category will automatically be used to answer this question.  Otherwise, you'll need to select the partner's professional category.  This answer is used to generate a list of potential reasons for the referral in the next step.</li>
								<li>Click the <b>Next</b> button.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><b>Step 3: Context</b>
							<ol type="a">
								<li><i>"The primary reason [Prospect] needs help from [Partner] now is because [Prospect]"</i>:  The answer helps the partner understand why the customer is in the market. Select one of the reasons - or choose "Other - see comments" and provide a note explaining why the referral is a timely one.</li>
								<li><i>"How soon is a response required?"</i>  Let your partner know whether an immediate response is required - or whether the timeframe is less urgent.</li>
								<li>Click the <b>Next</b> button.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><b>Step 4: Other</b>
							<ol type="a">
								<li>[Custom Questions] If you've selected a ReferralWire member as the partner - and he or she has set up custom questions in their profile - you'll see a list of the questions here.   Answer these to enable your partner to better qualify the prospect.  If the partner you've selected isn't connected to you on ReferralWire - or doesn't have any custom questions set up in his or her profile - no custom questions will appear.</li>
								<li><i>"Is [Prospect] expecting a call from [Partner]"</i>  Check this box to confirm that you've told the prospect about the partner in advance.</li>
								<li><i>"Next Steps"</i>: The partner will be notified of the referral via email.  If the partner is already a ReferralWire member, he or she will be able to log in directly and see the new referral on his or her home page. If the partner is not yet a ReferralWire member he or she will receive an email with an invitation to register.  Once the partner has registered he or she will be able to accept the referral and see the details inside as an existing member.</li>

						<li><span style="background-color:pink;font-weight:bold">Not Accepted Yet</span> This is initial value of a referral.  This status remains until the receiving partner has explicitly accepted the referral.</li>
						<li><span style="background-color:yellow;font-weight:bold">Accepted</span> The accepted status implies that the recipient has acknowledged the referral.  Accepted referrals are eligible to be "Confirmed."</li>
						<li><span style="background-color:#bbf9bb;font-weight:bold">Confirmed</span> Referral confirmation implies that the receiving partner has spoken with the prospect and that the prospect is interested.  When referral status is updated to "Confirmed" the prospect becomes a contact of the receiving partner.  This enables the receiving partner to forward the prospect on to others. It also causes a customer feedback email to be scheduled for delivery in 10 days. For more details see the section on <a href="#customerFeedback">Customer Feedback</a> below. Confirmed referrals are eligible to be "Converted."</li>
						<li><span style="background-color:#2E8B57;font-weight:bold">Converted</span> When the referral status is set to "Converted" it implies that a sale has been made. The prospect is now a customer of referral recipient.</li>
					</ul>
					In addition to having a status updated by the partner who receives it, a referral record also shows whether the prospect approves of the partner to whom they've been referred.  Feedback from the prospect is obtained through a very short email survey sent to the prospect 10 days after the referral has been confirmed.  When the prospect responds to the survey the referral will be updated with a thumbs up <img src="../images/thumbsUp.png"> or a thumbs down <img src="../images/thumbsDown.png"> icon indicating that feedback was received.

				<h3>The Lifecycle of a Power Partner Referral</h3>

					The status of every power partner referral changes based on updates made by the recipients. Possible status values are as follows:
					<ul>
						<li><span style="background-color:pink;font-weight:bold">Not Accepted Yet</span> This is initial value of a referral.  For the recipient looking at the referral, this status indicates the referral is waiting for a response from him or her.</li>
						<li><span style="background-color:orange;font-weight:bold">Waiting</span> Indicates that one of the two partners have accepted.</li>
						<li><span style="background-color:yellow;font-weight:bold">Accepted</span> The "Accepted" status implies that both recipients have accepted the referral and are now connected with one another.  </li>

				<h3>Archiving and Un-archiving Referrals</h3>
				<div class="tier2">
					You can archive a received referral at any time because there's no further action to take.  Doing so will remove the referral from your inbox.   Should you want to retrieve the referral later, it will be in a separate archive list which can be accessed by clicking on Menu > Referrrals and then clicking on the Archive tab on the lower right side of the page.  Archived referrals can be restored by selecting them and clicking "Unarchive" from this page.

				<h3>Tracking Updates Made by Your Partners</h3>
				<div class="tier2">
					The referrals that you've given to your partners are visible in four separate places within the <b>web application</b>:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Home Page</b> The panel titled: "Referrals from You: Recently <u>Updated</u> by your Partners" contains all the referrals that you've given <i>that have been updated by your partners in the last two weeks</i>.   The records are sorted according to how recently they've been updated. </li>
						<li><b>Referrals Given Page</b> -- shows a complete list of all the referrals you've given. To go to the page:
							<ol>
								<li>Click on <b><i>Menu >  Referrals</i></b></li>
								<li>Select the <b><i>Given</i></b> tab on the footer of the right side of the page.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><b>Partner Referrals Page</b>  -- shows a list of all the referrals received from and given to a particular partner. To go to the page:
							<ol>
								<li>Click on <b><i>Menu > Partners.</i></b></li>
								<li>Select the partner record whose referral activity you'd like to see.</li>
								<li>Select the <b><i>Referrals</i></b> tab on the footer of the right side of the page.</li>

				<h3>Customer Feedback</h3>
				<div class="tier2">
					When a partner accepts and then confirms a referral from you, ReferralWire schedules the delivery of a feedback survey to the contact.  The email is delivered to the contact 10 days after your partner marks the referral as "Confirmed."  The email prompts your contact to tell you whether you should refer more clients to the same partner.   A sample of the email text is as follows:
					<p>
						<img src="screenshots/customerFeedBackEmail.png">
					</p>
					When your contact replies to survey, you'll be notified by email. The contact's feedback is shown in the referral record with a thumbs up <img src="../images/thumbsUp.png"> or thumbs down <img src="../images/thumbsDown.png"> icon.
